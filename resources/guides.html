		  	<p>The Sims 4 is a vast game and after almost 5 years, players are still discovering new hidden features, and every new gamepack and expansion, comes with even more. Sometimes it's hard to keep up but we've creaded a few short guides to help you.</p>

  	        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
  	        <ul>
  	        	<li>
  	        		<h3>Aspirations</h3>
  	        		<p>Sims' Aspirations are your simss' life goals and they're set in Create a Sim mode. Each aspiration has unique tasks and milestones. For each task compleated, your sim earns Aspiration Points, which can be used to purchase reward traits. A sim's aspiration can only be changed once all tasks are completed or by using a cheat code.</p>
  	        	</li>
  	        	<li>
  	        		<h3>Emotions</h3>
  	        		<p>Sim's emotions affect a lot, including interactions with other sims, their willingness to complete certain tasks and their school/work performance. Almost every activity influences a Sims' mood either positively or negatively. Sims' moods can also be quickly modified with cheat codes.</p>
  	        	</li>
  	        	<li>
  	        		<h3>Relationships</h3>
  	        		<p>Once a sim introduces themselves to another, they become acquaintances and they will appear in each others relationship panel. Relationships improve or decrease based on the interactions they have. Relationships will also decrease if sims don't stay in contact.</p>
  	        	</li>
  	        	<li>
  	        		<h3>Traits</h3>
  	        		<p>Personality traits influence a sim's behaviour, moods and in some cases, how quickly they develop certain skills. 3 traits are chosen in Create a Sim and can only be changed by using a cheat. There are 4 different categories, Emotional Traits, Hobby Traits, Lifestyle Traits & Social Traits.</p>
  	        	</li>
  	        	<li>
  	        		<h3>Skills</h3>
  	        		<p>Sim's skills can be built with certain activities or by reading a skills book. Specific skill levels influence their performance and ability to perform certain tasks. Your sim's skill panel displays all of their skills and the levels.</p>

	    <div id="menu1" class="tab-pane fade">
	    	<h3>Building</h3>
	      	<ul>
  	        	<li>Your sim can buy and place a home from the library or you can choose to build  home from scratch.</li>
  	        	<li>You can have a maximum of 4 floor levels and 2 basement levels.</li>
  	        	<li>There are 3 different wall heights in The Sims 4 and 5 half-wall options.</li>
  	        	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC65SbK7DTllBxF7Uzinkgdg" target="blank">The Sim Supply</a> has a great video on building tips and cheats.

	      	<h3>Create a Sim</h3>
	      	<ul>
		      	<li>For some, creating a sim is the best part of the game. The process has come a long way since the first game and now allows you edit sim features and body type.</li>
  	        	<li>Once you have created your sim, certain areas cannot be edited again...unless of course you use the cheat "cas.fulleditmode" which allows you to edit all of your sim's features and traits later.</li>
  	        	<li>The base game and all of the expansions and gamepacks come with additional CAS items. There's also the option of adding custom fan-made content to your game. See <a href="mods">The Custom Contant Page </a>for more info on Mods and Custom Content.</li>
